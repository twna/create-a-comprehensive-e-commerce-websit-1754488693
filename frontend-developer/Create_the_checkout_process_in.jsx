    "summary": "Implemented a simple Checkout component in React that integrates with the existing CartContext to display the total price and handle the checkout process. The component provides a button to place the order, which for now simply clears the cart and sets a flag indicating that the order has been placed. This is a placeholder for the actual payment processing logic.",
