This implementation assumes that another team member has created a `CartContext` which provides the cart state and functions to manipulate the cart. The `ShoppingCart` component uses this context to display cart items, remove individual items, and clear the entire cart. It is designed to integrate with the existing system and assumes that the `CartContext` is already in place.
